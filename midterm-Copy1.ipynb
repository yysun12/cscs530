    "## Smoking Model Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "###Goal\n",
    "We will examine individual smoker's decision to quit smoking and how their decisions influence others via socia interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "Due to the heterogeneity of individual smoker in the model, we use Agent Based Modeling (ABM) to model each individual as an agent and study the agent's decision making process. In addition, given the social contagion of smoking, we will construct social networks in the model to mimic social interactions and use network analysis to investigate how smoking cessation spreads on a network. Thus ABM and social network analysis are necessary in this study. ODE models cannot adequately address the heterogeneity nor the social network structure of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Outline\n",
    "-implement smoking prevention programs\n",
    "\n",
    "-implement smoking treatment programs\n",
    "\n",
    "-observe natural progress of smoking population without interventions, pay attention to whether smokers/non-smokers form clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "-compare effectiveness of intervention programs by observing the number of smokers in the network and corresponding social network structure\n",
    "\n",
    "-Observe smoking prevalence as well as smoking cessation rate at each time step\n",
    "\n",
    "We then break the model down into serveral pieces to better describe it: \n",
    "\n",
    "###I. Space\n",
    "In the model, we have a social network space that follows a power-law distribution at the baseline. Then a randomly selected 10% of the links rewind at each time period. Agent will be assigned index to better track their friendships in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "###II. Actors\n",
    "####A. People\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, people are individuals who are smokers. And they have the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "####Properties\n",
    "1. age: how old is the person? We only look at adults between 21 and 64 years old. \n",
    "2. gender: what is the gender of the person? Male or female.\n",
    "3. ethnicity: what is the person's ethnicity? Here we use white, black and other to simplify the model. \n",
    "4. socal_class: what is the social class of the person? We use a binary variable, low vs high-income. \n",
    "5. education: how much education has the person received? We use 3 categories: below hight school, high school graduates, college or higher. \n",
    "6. is_smoker: is this person a smoker? \n",
    "7. smoking_cessation: what is the probability that a perosn will quit smoking? The value of this variable is calculated as a function of variables from 1 to 5 listed above. \n",
    "8. success_rate: what is the probability that the person will quit smoking successfully? We will set this value to be the same across population. \n",
    "9. prob_smoking: what is the probability that the person will start smoking if non-smoker? A randomly assigned value from a uniform distribution. \n",
    "10. id: what is the id number of the agent? Each agent will get a unique index number from 1 to 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For their step function, agent will perform the following:\n",
    "1. evaluate the probability of smoking cessation, then draw a random number from 0 and 1, if the random number is bigger than the probabiliy, then might quit smoking. Otherwise will stay as a smoker at this time period. \n",
    "2. based on success_rate, we randomly pick a certain porportion of the population to quit smoking successfully. These people will stay as non-smoker at this time period. \n",
    "3. evaluate the number of friends they have at this time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "####B. Network\n",
    "A social network exists within the population with the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "1. size: how big is the network? The number of nodes is the same as the size of the population, which is set to be 10,000. \n",
    "2. type: what is the type of the network? Here we set it to be a scale-free network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For their step function, network sill perform the following:\n",
    "1. evaluate the number of edges each node has. \n",
    "2. pick 10% of the edges randomly and rewind them. For the rewinding process, half of the edges will rewind randomly while the other half will rewind to connect only agents with same ethnicity and social status. \n",
    "\n",
    "###III. Initial Conditions\n",
    "#### A. People\n",
    "- people will be randomly distributed throughout the network using a uniform distribution with replacement. And the corresponding characteristics will also be randomly assigned to them using uniform distribution with replacement. \n",
    "- people have their own probability of stop smoking as a function of their characteristics and social network. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Space\n",
    "- A power-law network will be constructed at the initial time. Then for every time step, a randomly selected 10% of the edges will rewind. The edge selected will be deleted. Then two nodes (index for agents) will be picked and an edge will be constrcuted connecting these two nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Model Parameters\n",
    "Based on the description above, we will have three different models: the baseline model, prevention model and treatment model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Sweep Values\n",
    "I plan to change values of smoking cessation success rate in the model. I think all the outcome vectors will be affected by the sweep, including the number of smokers, number of non-smokers and smoking cessation rate at each time step. \n",
    "I also want to test how network structures influence smoking. But I am not sure if I will have enough time for this. "
